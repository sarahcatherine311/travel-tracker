# Travel Tracker

## Abstract
This web application was focused on creating a dashboard with easy to read information about a user's past and upcoming trips. Users are able to login with a username and password, and then are taken to their home page where they can see their past and upcoming trips and also book a new trip. I worked with a local server and made network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data. The user is able to post to the trips endpoint of the api and have their new trip show up on the DOM.

## Setup
Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/sarahcatherine311/travel-tracker) and then in a different folder, fork and clone this [local server repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api).

Do the following steps for both repos. Both repos need to be running in order for the app to work correctly.

In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key. 
Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.

Install the library dependencies:

Run: ```npm install```
Next: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

## Reflections: 
I am currently in the last week of Module two for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program, a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This is my second solo project that was completed in 5 days in line with the project specification and rubric detailed [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html). 

## Technologies Used:
Javascript | Mocha & Chai | API | CSS | HTML
